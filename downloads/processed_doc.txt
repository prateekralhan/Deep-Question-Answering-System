When
Spider
Man
first
appeared
in
the
early
s
teenagers
in
superhero
comic
books
were
usually
relegated
to
the
role
of
sidekick
to
the
protagonist
The
Spider
Man
series
broke
ground
by
featuring
Peter
Parker
a
high
school
student
from
Queens
behind
Spider
Man
s
secret
identity
and
with
whose
self
obsessions
with
rejection
inadequacy
and
loneliness
young
readers
could
relate

While
Spider
Man
had
all
the
makings
of
a
sidekick
unlike
previous
teen
heroes
such
as
Bucky
and
Robin
Spider
Man
had
no
superhero
mentor
like
Captain
America
and
Batman
he
thus
had
to
learn
for
himself
that
with
great
power
there
must
also
come
great
responsibility

in
a
text
box
in
the
final
panel
of
the
first
Spider
Man
story
but
later
retroactively
attributed
to
his
guardian
his
late
Uncle
Ben
Parker
